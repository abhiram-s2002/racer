# Self-Ping Prevention Fix

## Issue
Users could ping themselves, which doesn't make sense in a marketplace context.

## Simple Fix
Added a simple validation check in the `HomeScreen` component to prevent users from pinging themselves.

## What Was Added
```typescript
// Prevent users from pinging themselves
if (currentUser.username === seller.username) {
  Alert.alert(
    'Cannot Send Ping',
    'You cannot ping yourself.',
    [{ text: 'OK' }]
  );
  return;
}
```

## Where It Was Added
- **File**: `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`
- **Location**: In the `confirmSendPing` function, right after message validation
- **Timing**: Before any ping creation attempts (both online and offline)

## How It Works
1. **Simple Check**: Compares `currentUser.username` with `seller.username`
2. **Direct Alert**: If they match, shows a clear alert message
3. **User-Friendly**: Shows "Cannot Send Ping" with "You cannot ping yourself." message
4. **Early Return**: Stops the ping process after showing the message
5. **Consistent**: Works for both online and offline ping attempts

## Benefits
- ✅ **Prevents self-pings** - Users can't ping themselves
- ✅ **Simple implementation** - Just one line of validation
- ✅ **Clear error message** - Users understand why it failed
- ✅ **No performance impact** - Quick string comparison
- ✅ **Consistent behavior** - Works in all scenarios

## Result
Users now get a clear error message when trying to ping themselves, and the ping is prevented from being created.
