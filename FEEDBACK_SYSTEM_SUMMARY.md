# Intelligent Feedback System with Contextual Questions

## Overview
The feedback system has been enhanced with intelligent contextual questioning based on user ratings. This creates a more personalized and targeted feedback collection experience that adapts to how users feel about the app.

## New Intelligent Features

### 1. Contextual Questions Based on Rating
The system now asks different questions depending on the user's rating:

#### ⭐⭐ (1-2 Stars) - "We need to improve"
**For 1 Star:**
- "We're sorry to hear that. What went wrong?"
- Questions focus on identifying specific problems:
  - What was the main issue you encountered?
  - Was there a specific feature that didn't work?
  - Did you have trouble finding what you were looking for?
  - Was the app too slow or buggy?
  - Did something crash or not work as expected?

**For 2 Stars:**
- "We'd like to improve. What could be better?"
- Questions focus on improvement areas:
  - What was frustrating about your experience?
  - Which features need improvement?
  - Was the interface confusing in any way?
  - Did you have trouble with the ping system?
  - Were the listings not what you expected?

#### ⭐⭐⭐ (3 Stars) - "Let's make it great"
- "Thanks for your feedback! What could make it better?"
- Questions focus on potential improvements:
  - What would make you rate it higher?
  - Which features could be improved?
  - Was anything confusing or unclear?
  - Did you find everything you were looking for?
  - What would make you use the app more?

#### ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4 Stars) - "What made it good?"
- "Great! What made it good for you?"
- Questions focus on positive aspects:
  - What features did you like the most?
  - Was the ping system helpful?
  - Did you find good listings easily?
  - Was the interface easy to use?
  - What would make it even better?

#### ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5 Stars) - "Tell us what made it perfect!"
- "Amazing! We're thrilled you love it!"
- Questions focus on what made it exceptional:
  - What features did you love the most?
  - Was the ping system exactly what you needed?
  - Did you find exactly what you were looking for?
  - What made the experience so great?
  - Would you recommend it to friends? Why?

### 2. Smart Interface Adaptation

- **Medium ratings (3)**: Balance between issues and potential improvements
